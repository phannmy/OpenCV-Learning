image sharpening is to sharpen the image, in this case using filter2D to use a kernel and filter making the image 
more clear.

We use the numpy to create a kernel for sharpening:
np.array([[0,-1,0],
         [-1,5,-1],
         [0,-1,0]])
this kernel will reduce the clearance of everything beside it's middle part and enhance it. This make it more clear 
and sharpen the image.
