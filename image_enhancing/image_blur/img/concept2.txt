to read an image we use 
a=cv2.imread("file name") instead of file name we can also use file path

to create a gui window for displaying image on screen we use 
cv2.imshow("file name",a)

to keep the gui window open, we use the code
cv2.waitkey(0)
the "0" is used as the ammount of time the gui window will be hold open. It should always be positive 
number or 0, the number 0 will keep the gui window open until the user closed It
